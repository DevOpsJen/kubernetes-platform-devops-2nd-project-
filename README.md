This repository demonstrates a **production-grade Kubernetes platform**
designed with DevOps culture, GitOps principles, multi-environment deployments,
security, observability, and resilience.

- prod  → stable, protected, monitored

## Key Capabilities

- CI with GitHub Actions
- Kubernetes multi-environment design
- Auto-scaling (HPA)
- Canary deployments
- Chaos engineering
- Monitoring & alerting
- Strong documentation & runbooks

## DevOps Principles
- Git is the source of truth
- Automation over manual work
- Security by default
- Observability over guessing
- Failure is expected and engineered
